90#VERS#COMMENT##: The text appears to be quite clean; occasionally some extra elements that must have
  been added for structural clarity of the book; text is structured quite well, but still takes time to sort things out;
  structure of the book - juzʾ > settlement > ṭabaqaŧ > tribe/group; includes about 4,700 biogaphical records (another edition numbers ~5,500)
